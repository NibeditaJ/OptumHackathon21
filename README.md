Project submitted for company hackathon 2021

Problem Statement: Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment condition associated with significant healthcare costs, and early diagnosis 
can significantly reduce these. Unfortunately, waiting times for an ASD diagnosis are lengthy and procedures are not cost effective. 
The economic impact of autism and the increase in the number of ASD cases during the time of pandemic across the world reveals an urgent need for the 
development of easily implemented and effective screening method.

Solution: Autism Predictor, An AI/ML ebabled webapp which is designed to get instant prediction of the disorder. 
It is a time-efficient and accessible ASD screening webapp, which is imminent to help health professionals and inform individuals whether they should 
pursue formal clinical diagnosis or not. It will help for early diagnosis in a cost effective way.
 
 
 
 Architecture:
 Lets give you a brief about the architecture or flow of our project. In the first step we have collected raw data and stored in form of CSV file.
 This data is used to train the ML model using different algos. So, when we get the user input via our webapp i.e. built using HTML, 
 the ML model runs in backend and evaluates the data to predict the result, which is posted on the webapp.
